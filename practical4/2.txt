Class SuperB
▪ This class represents a superclass containing four methods: setIt, increase, 
triple, and returnIt. 
▪ The instance variable x's value is set with the setIt method. 
▪ The increase method increases the value of x by 1. 
▪ The value of x is multiplied by three using the triple method. ▪ The returnIt 
method returns the current value of x.
class SubC extends SuperB 
▪ In order to become a subclass of SuperB, this class extends the SuperB class. 
▪ Instead of multiplying x by 3, it adds 3 to the x value instead of using the 
triple function from the superclass. 
▪ Additionally, it adds a new method called quadruple, which multiplies the 
value of x by 4.
public class TestInheritance
▪ This class has the main method where the behavior of inheritance is tested. 
▪ In the beginning, it creates a SuperB instance called b. 
▪ Using the setIt method, it initializes b to 2 in this case. 
▪ Following that, it increases b's value by 1, making x equal to 3. 
▪ The triple method is then used to triple the value of b, so x becomes 9. 
▪ Finally, using the returnIt method, it prints the current value of b. then it 
makes a SubC instance with the name c. 
▪ Using the setIt method, it initializes c to the value 2. 
▪ Then it uses the increase method to increase the C value by 1, so x becomes 
. 
▪ Then, using the triple method, which is overridden in the SubC class, it 
triples the value of c, so x becomes 6. 
▪ Using the returned method, it prints the current value of C
